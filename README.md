# Iris Flower Classification Using Tenserflow


This script demonstrates how to train a neural network model for classifying Iris flower species using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
Ensure you have the CSV file containing the Iris flower dataset.
Update the file path in the script (`file_path`) to point to your CSV file.
Training is done using a validation split of 0.3 and 200 epochs reaching an accuracy of ~96%.
